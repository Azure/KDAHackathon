## Proctor Guide
1. Power Point attached can be customized as needed. It contains context about the game and service to help attendies learn. 
2. Use the power point to present content on the board during the workshop.

SPOILER ALERT: 
1. KQL files contain thought process of how someone solved the Onboarding, Case 1 (Missing Book) and Case 2 (Election Fraud) of Season 1. Realisticly we will not make it pass case 2 due to time constraints. However, if there's time during your workshop delivery, then please continue procotoring the Kusto Detective Agency additional cases and/or help attendies with QnA. 
2. Additional guidance for Season 1 (by official [AvivYaniv](https://gist.github.com/AvivYaniv)) can be found [here](https://medium.com/courisity-is-a-drug/walk-through-guide-for-kusto-detective-agency-onboarding-level-5ed569e3b123).
