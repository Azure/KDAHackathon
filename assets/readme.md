## Proctor Guide üß≠
1. Make it fun! If you've never been in a panic room is okay. Imagine it. It's like production-down emergency, a bit if stressful but respectful. Instill focus and urgency.
2. Power Point attached can be customized as needed. It contains context about the game and service to help attendies learn. 
3. Use the power point to present content on the board during the workshop.
4. Break attendies into teams, ie. ~30 attendies, ~8 teams, ~4 ppl per team (small teams) so they can help each other. Its better if they team up with someone they havent met, try to instruct seating with someone they havent met at the begining. 
5. Use competition board, if desired. This requires access and editing the KQL query used by the dashboard and attendies providing their free cluster (personal cluster) urls to the proctor. (New version comming soon!)

### Timeline: ‚è±Ô∏è
1. Overview slides (10-15m)
2. Intro the game based on the lang/service (20-30m)
3. Demo (15-20m)
4. Game On! Give attendies at 20-30mins to attempt to solve on their own. Then show your instructior-proceess to get the answer. Zoom into the queries for attendies to see and copy so they can unlock the next case.
5. Break the workshop into slots of 1hr, 2hr, & another 2hr. with a 10-15m break in between. For example, start 1hr, onboarding + case 1 1-2hr, case 2 1-2hr.
6. Walk the room

### SPOILER ALERT: ‚ö†Ô∏è
1. KQL files contain thought process of how someone solved the Onboarding, Case 1 (Missing Book) and Case 2 (Election Fraud) of Season 1. Realisticly we will not make it pass case 2 due to time constraints. However, if there's time during your workshop delivery, then please continue procotoring the Kusto Detective Agency additional cases and/or help attendies with QnA. 
2. Additional guidance for Season 1 (by official [AvivYaniv](https://gist.github.com/AvivYaniv)) can be found [here](https://medium.com/courisity-is-a-drug/walk-through-guide-for-kusto-detective-agency-onboarding-level-5ed569e3b123).
